		<h1> The Evolution of the Bycicle </h1>
		<div class=" col1 ">

			<h2>The First Bicycle</h2>
			<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens
				faster: two same-size
				in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device
				was
				propelled by
				pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of
				gliding
				walk.</p>
			<p> The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This
				enjoyed a short
				lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well
				maintained pathway
				such as in a park or garden. </p>

			<h2> Further Innovations </h2>
			<p> The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when pedals were applied directly
                    to
                    the front wheel. This
                    machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker," since its
                    wooden structure combined
                    with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a
                    fad
                    and indoor riding
                    academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities. </p>
			<p> In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. (Prior
                    to this, metallurgy was not advanced enough to provide metal which was strong enough to make small,
                    light parts out of.)
                    The pedals were attached directly to the front wheel with no freewheeling mechanism. Solid rubber
                    tires
                    and the long
                    spokes of the large front wheel provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor. </p>
